<div class="post">
<p>One of our clients asked us to help recruit a team of designers in India then take them through our UX/UI training course. We jumped on the opportunity because it sounded cool, but once we got in the groove, it more than exceeded our expectations: We met some amazing friends and learned so much from them. We found out that there are more than 60 different types of curries (I think we had a different type every day we were there). The architecture and dress were so detailed, intricate and bright. It was an experience we&#39;ll always remember and be ever inspired by this amazing culture. Thanks, India!</p>
