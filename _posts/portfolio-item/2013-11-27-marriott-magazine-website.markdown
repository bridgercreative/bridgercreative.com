A quarterly publication associated with Brigham Young Universityâ€™s Marriott School of Business.  Marriott Alumni Magazine provides content that is distributed through traditional print media. Recognizing the need to expand the magazine to a digital platform as well, Bridger designed a device responsive website that is viewable on multiple platforms, such as web, and mobile.  Connecting alumni and sharing stories that inspire, regardless of where their audience is.
