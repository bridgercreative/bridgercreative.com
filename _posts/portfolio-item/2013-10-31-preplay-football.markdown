Are you ready for some football? Are you ready to test your play-calling skills? Are you smarter than your buddies, or better yet, the coach on the team sideline? Let's see you prove yourself.


CBS PrePlay is an app that allows you to predict the next play of any professional football game and a good number of college games. Even though our coaching skills won't get us a job as a football coach, we're quite proud of the branding and UX/UI we created for the game.
