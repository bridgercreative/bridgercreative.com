One of our clients asked us to help recruit a team of designers in India then take them through our UX/UI training course. We jumped on the opportunity because it sounded cool, but once we got in the groove, it more than exceeded our expectations: We met some amazing friends and learned so much from them. We found out that there are more than 60 different types of curries (I think we had a different type every day we were there). The architecture and dress were so detailed, intricate and bright. It was an experience we'll always remember and be ever inspired by this amazing culture. Thanks, India!
