    Heroes in a half shell... and bandages! Because this turtle gang isn''t complete
    without all 4 ninja''s and each one has their own strength, we designed this as
    a 4-piece set. Each turtle got their own carton. We even included a nice slice
    of pizza in every box. Turtle Power!

    We find our job to be really cool, but these guys' job is utterly
    thrilling. Imagine hucking yourself off an endless cliff or speed flying through
    an icy crevice. Well that's what the GoPro Bomb Squad does for their paycheck.\n\n\nWe
    designed their branding to reflect who they are, a death-defying team that transforms
    themselves into speeding falcons, the fastest birds in the sky blue air. We also
    created a \n[reel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2LkQ8JXOUk) for them to introduce
    the stellar team. Next time you see a large bird in the air, it may be the GoPro
    Bomb Squad.

    happen: 1) kids make their way out in the open and "ouchies" start to appear on
    their elbows and knees; and 2) Moms start arming their artillery with band-aids,
    gauze and sprays.
