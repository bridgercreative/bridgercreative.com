      <div class="profile-description">
        <p>After starting a neighborhood T-shirt business with his brother at the age of 10 (painting custom designs at $5 a pop), Matt was hooked on seeing how people interacted with design. Since then, he has learned from some of the most influential and inspirational designers working at Pentagram, Axis41, Lippincott and Johnson &amp; Johnson Global Strategic Design Office. Coming full circle, Matt has teamed back up with his brother to continue their creative journey.</p>

<p>Matt specializes in branding, packaging, user experience and web design. He has been recognized in Print Magazine, Communication Arts, Mohawk, AIGA and more. Classically trained with a BFA in Graphic Design from Brigham Young University, Matt thrives on helping people interact with design in an experiential and visual way. When he&#39;s not in the office, you can find him on a bike, on a board, or playing Barbies with his little girls.</p>
