    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From road to runway, the tüb trend is transforming bicycling and UPcycling and taking it to the next level: FASHION. When you support the tüb trend, you are keeping used inner tubes and old signs from the landfill. Plus, all of tübs products are designed and sewn right here in our neighborhood in the USA, using locally sourced materials! We love bikes and we love the earth.</p>

<p>These tübs are FLAT BUT NOT FORGOTTEN!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Deseret Industries is a nonprofit business enterprise owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, designed to provide employment and to aid in the economic rehabilitation of disadvantaged persons.</p>

<p>They asked us to explore new ideas for their brand to communicate their heritage (established in 1936) and mission of caring for the poor and needy and helping transform lives. We ended up on a nice refresh of their iconic worker bee, which we were happy with since that&#39;s the same busy bee we grew up with.</p>
