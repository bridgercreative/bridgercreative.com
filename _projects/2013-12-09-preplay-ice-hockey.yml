description: ! "If you're only watching ice hockey for the brawls, think again at
  what this game has in store. NHL games will be more exciting when you can predict
  the next play. And you can prove to your buddies that you're more than a fragile
  ice dancer.\r\n\r\nNHL PrePlay is an app that allows you to predict every play of
  every NHL game. Even though our coaching skills won't get us a job as a hockey coach,
  we're quite proud of the branding and UX/UI we created for the game."
