description: ! 'We find our job to be really cool, but these guys'' job is utterly

  thrilling. Imagine hucking yourself off an endless cliff or speed flying through

  an icy crevice. Well that''s what the GoPro Bomb Squad does for their paycheck.\n\n\nWe

  designed their branding to reflect who they are, a death-defying team that transforms

  themselves into speeding falcons, the fastest birds in the sky blue air. We also

  created a \n[reel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2LkQ8JXOUk) for them to introduce

  the stellar team. Next time you see a large bird in the air, it may be the GoPro

  Bomb Squad.'
