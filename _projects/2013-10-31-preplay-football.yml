description: ! "Are you ready for some football? Are you ready to test your play-calling
  skills? Are you smarter than your buddies, or better yet, the coach on the team
  sideline? Let's see you prove yourself.\r\n\r\nCBS PrePlay is an app that allows
  you to predict the next play of any professional football game and a good number
  of college games. Even though our coaching skills won't get us a job as a football
  coach, we're quite proud of the branding and UX/UI we created for the game."
