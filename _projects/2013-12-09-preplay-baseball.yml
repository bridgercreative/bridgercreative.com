description: ! "Take me out to the ball game. Or keep me in to watch my tube. Either
  way, any MLB baseball game will be more exciting when you can guess every at-bat
  of every game. Are those hand signals, brim swiping and crotch scratches too confusing
  to read? Well, prove to yourself or your buddies that you can call the plays.\r\n\r\nMLB
  PrePlay is an app that allows you to predict every at-bat of every MLB game. Even
  though our coaching skills won't get us a job as a baseball manager, we're quite
  proud of the branding and UX/UI we created for the game."
