description: ! "We find our job to be really cool, but these guys' job is utterly
  thrilling. Imagine hucking yourself off an endless cliff or speed flying through
  an icy crevice. Well that's what the GoPro Bomb Squad does for their paycheck.\r\n\r\nWe
  designed their branding to reflect who they are, a death-defying team that transforms
  themselves into speeding falcons, the fastest birds in the sky blue air. We also
  created a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2LkQ8JXOUk\"target=\"_blank\">reel</a>
  for them to introduce the stellar team. Next time you see a large bird in the air,
  it may be the GoPro Bomb Squad. "
