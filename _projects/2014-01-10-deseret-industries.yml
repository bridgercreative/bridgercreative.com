description: ! "Deseret Industries is a nonprofit business enterprise owned and operated
  by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, designed to provide employment
  and to aid in the economic rehabilitation of disadvantaged persons. \r\n\r\nThey
  asked us to explore new ideas for their brand to communicate their heritage (established
  in 1936) and mission of caring for the poor and needy and helping transform lives.
  We ended up on a nice refresh of their iconic worker bee, which we were happy with
  since that's the same busy bee we grew up with."
