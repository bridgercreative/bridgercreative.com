  Who says you can't look good with scrapes and cuts on your body and extremities? While at Johnson & Johnson we teamed up with the fashion designer Cynthia Rowley on this elegant 'Dress Up' theme so you can accessorize your cut to your sleek dress or pumps. We even brought back the classic tin (and monster tin) as a collector's item and got to display them at the 
  [Cooper Hewitt Design Museum](http://www.cooperhewitt.org/) in NYC. OUCH!
