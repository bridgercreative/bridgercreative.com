description: ! 'Every year around spring time when the weather warms, two big things
  start to

  happen: 1) kids make their way out in the open and "ouchies" start to appear on

  their elbows and knees; and 2) Moms start arming their artillery with band-aids,

  gauze and sprays.


  Johnson & Johnson asked us to design a logo that illustrates the connection and

  love between the parent and child day in and day out.'
