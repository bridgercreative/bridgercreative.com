description: ! "Every year around spring time when the weather warms, two big things
  start to happen: 1) kids make their way out in the open and \"ouchies\" start to
  appear on their elbows and knees; and 2) Moms start arming their artillery with
  band-aids, gauze and sprays.\r\n\r\nJohnson & Johnson asked us to design a logo
  that illustrates the connection and love between the parent and child day in and
  day out."
