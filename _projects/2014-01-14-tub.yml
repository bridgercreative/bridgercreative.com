description: ! "From road to runway, the tüb trend is transforming bicycling and UPcycling
  and taking it to the next level: FASHION. When you support the tüb trend, you are
  keeping used inner tubes and old signs from the landfill. Plus, all of tübs products
  are designed and sewn right here in our neighborhood in the USA, using locally sourced
  materials! We love bikes and we love the earth. \r\n\r\nThese tübs are FLAT BUT
  NOT FORGOTTEN!"
